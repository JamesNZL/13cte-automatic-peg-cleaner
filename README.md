# Automatic Peg Cleaner

My NCEA Level 3 Control Technology project, for 13CTE.

## Issue

> Upon removal from the ground, my stakeholderâ€™s tent pegs always have large amounts of soil and dirt stuck in between the three protruding beams.
> This is a common issue experienced with all tent pegs, but particularly Y stakes such as his, a Sea to Summit Ground Control Peg, but also similar products from other brands such as an MSR Groundhog.
> These pegs are very popular due to their high holding power and strength to weight ratio, with three beams to maximise the surface area of ground contact, and therefore the amount of friction.
> This also means that upon removal soil band dirt is likely to stick to the beams, particularly in softer ground with more moisture.

## Operating Principle

> Once a peg has been inserted through the hole in the top of the product, the laser tripwire is broken and the water jets automatically engage.
> Once the tripwire re-arms, the water jets disengage and the process repeats.
> If the laser tripwire is left intact for 3 minutes, the product will automatically turn itself off to conserve battery life.

## Conceptual Statement

> An intuitive, automated, eco-friendly solution to unreasonably dirty tent pegs of all shapes and sizes, this product easily cleans pegs to a brand new condition using high pressure water jets, automatically triggered by a laser tripwire.
> Economical in its water and energy consumption, all water used is also stored for recycling, and is easily used to water plants and flowers.
